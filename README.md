## Ingestion of Data using Data Pipelines

In this lab we will go through the data integration capabilities in Fabric through the tutorial for [Data Factory end-to-end scenario](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/tutorial-end-to-end-introduction). In module 1 you'll learn how to make a data pipeline to load data into Fabric for further transformation and use.

## Notebooks & Data Transformation using Dataflow Gen2

In this lab we will go through the tutorial on [Transform Data with a Dataflow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/tutorial-end-to-end-pipeline). The focus is on module 2 and 3, while module 1 is a fast reiteration of copying data into a lakehouse. Without data there is not much to transform.

We will also introduce notebooks as a way of transforming data, but as we will be visiting them again with Machine Learning their hands-on experience will come later. 

## Data Warehouse in Fabric

In this lab we will go through the "Data Warehouse" experience from the [Multi-experience Tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-warehouse/tutorial-introduction). This is intended to showcase the capabilities of Data Warehousing inside of Microsoft Fabric.

First we will however start with a presentation of the capabilities of Fabric data warehousing, how it differs from other Microsoft data warehousing, and when to use it. 

## Data Science in Fabric

In this lab we will go through the "Data Science" experience from the [Multi-experience Tutorials](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/tutorial-data-science-introduction). This tutorial introduces the different Data Science capabilities of Microsoft Fabric.

Before we start, we look at the machine learning life cycle and how different features in Microsoft Fabric enable Data Science from data exploration and analysis to model development and deployment.

## Real-Time Analytics in Fabric

This lab will focus on the Kusto Experience in Fabric and use the [Real-time tutorial from Microsoft online](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/real-time-analytics/tutorial-introduction). 
This lab is intended to demo the different possibilities with Kusto inside the unified experience of Fabric.

## Direct Lake with Fabric

The content for this lab is located [here](https://github.com/CHMAND/FabricLabs/blob/main/Lab%20-%20Build%20a%20Direct%20Lake%20dataset.pdf). It is inspired by [Lakehouse end-to-end scenario: overview and architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/tutorial-lakehouse-introduction). This lab is more basic and focus on creating a simple lakehouse, simple ingestion of sample data, a Direct Lake dataset and creating a report.
